# üî¨ Super-Diagnostic CI Workflow - Deployment Complete

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Commit:** `c44b46a`  
**Branch:** `feature/implement-audit-fixes`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED AND ACTIVE**

---

## üéØ Mission

Diagnose and resolve persistent `FileNotFoundError` issues in CI environment by implementing comprehensive diagnostic logging.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implemented Diagnostic Features

### **1. Git LFS Support ‚úÖ**

**Location:** Both `tests-unit` and `tests-e2e` jobs

**Change:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    lfs: true  # Enable Git LFS support if needed
```

**Purpose:**
- Ensures large files tracked by Git LFS are properly downloaded
- Prevents missing binary/large fixture files

**Impact:**
- If project uses Git LFS, files will now be fully materialized
- No performance impact if LFS not used

---

### **2. [DEBUG] Environment and File Structure Step ‚úÖ**

**Location:** Both `tests-unit` and `tests-e2e` jobs  
**Position:** After "Install deps", before test execution

**What It Does:**

```yaml
- name: "[DEBUG] Environment and File Structure"
  run: |
    # Shows comprehensive file system and environment state
```

**Diagnostic Checks:**

#### **A. Working Directory**
```bash
pwd
```
**Reveals:** Exact location where tests are executed

#### **B. Directory Listings**
```bash
ls -la tests/
ls -la tests/fixtures/
ls -la tests/golden/
```
**Reveals:** 
- All subdirectories and files
- Permissions and timestamps
- Hidden files (if any)

#### **C. Specific File Verification**
```bash
ls -la tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl
ls -la tests/golden/EDGE_REPORT_case1.json
```
**Reveals:**
- Whether critical test files exist
- Exact path where CI looks for them
- File size and permissions

#### **D. File Counts**
```bash
find tests/fixtures/ -type f | wc -l
find tests/golden/ -type f | wc -l
```
**Expected:**
- `tests/fixtures/`: 71 files
- `tests/golden/`: 62 files

**Reveals:** Whether all files were checked out

#### **E. Python Environment**
```bash
python --version
which python
echo "PYTHONPATH: $PYTHONPATH"
```
**Reveals:**
- Python version (should be 3.11)
- Python executable location
- PYTHONPATH configuration

---

### **3. [DEBUG] Run Single Failing Test Step ‚úÖ**

**Location:** Both `tests-unit` and `tests-e2e` jobs  
**Position:** After diagnostic check, before main tests

**Configuration:**
```yaml
- name: "[DEBUG] Run Single Failing Test"
  continue-on-error: true
  run: |
    python -m pytest tests/test_finops_exporter_unit.py -v --tb=short
```

**Purpose:**
- Isolate one known failing test
- Get detailed traceback
- Doesn't block main test execution

**Test Selected:** `tests/test_finops_exporter_unit.py`

**Why This Test:**
- Representative of FileNotFoundError issues
- Small enough to diagnose quickly
- Part of critical functionality

**Options:**
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `--tb=short`: Short traceback format
- `continue-on-error: true`: Doesn't fail the workflow

**Expected Output:**
```
FAILED tests/test_finops_exporter_unit.py::test_something - FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'tests/fixtures/...'
```

## üìä Diagnostic Output Example

### **Expected Successful Output:**

```
============================================
CI DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION
============================================

--- Current Working Directory ---
/home/runner/work/mm-bot/mm-bot

--- Directory Structure (tests/) ---
drwxr-xr-x  15 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 tests/
drwxr-xr-x   8 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 fixtures/
drwxr-xr-x   3 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 golden/
...

--- tests/fixtures/ Contents ---
total 123
drwxr-xr-x  8 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 15 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 anomaly
drwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker  4096 Oct  2 12:00 audit

--- Specific File Checks ---
tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl:
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 1234 Oct  2 12:00 tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl
tests/golden/EDGE_REPORT_case1.json:
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 5678 Oct  2 12:00 tests/golden/EDGE_REPORT_case1.json

--- File Counts ---
tests/fixtures/ files: 71
tests/golden/ files: 62

--- Python Environment ---
Python 3.11.x
/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.11.x/x64/bin/python

```

### **Expected Failure Output:**

```
--- Specific File Checks ---
tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl:
  NOT FOUND
```

## üîç How to Use Diagnostic Output

### **Scenario 1: Files Exist, Tests Still Fail**

**Diagnostic Shows:**
```
tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl:
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 1234 Oct  2 12:00 tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl
```

**But test error says:**
```
FileNotFoundError: fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl
```

**Diagnosis:** **Path mismatch!**
- File exists at: `tests/fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl`
- Test looks for: `fixtures/audit/chain_ok.jsonl` (missing `tests/`)

**Fix:** Update test to use correct relative path or ensure PYTHONPATH is correct.

---

### **Scenario 2: Files Missing**

**Diagnostic Shows:**
```
--- File Counts ---
tests/fixtures/ files: 0
tests/golden/ files: 0
```

**Diagnosis:** **Checkout problem!**
- Files not in Git
- .gitignore excluding them
- Sparse checkout limiting files

**Fix:** 
1. Check `.gitignore`
2. Verify `git ls-files tests/fixtures/` locally
3. Ensure checkout@v4 has no `sparse-checkout` option

---

### **Scenario 3: Wrong Working Directory**

**Diagnostic Shows:**
```
--- Current Working Directory ---
/home/runner/work/mm-bot/mm-bot/some/weird/path
```

**Expected:**
```
/home/runner/work/mm-bot/mm-bot
```

**Diagnosis:** **WORKDIR issue!**

**Fix:** Check if any steps change directory without returning.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### **Step 1: Monitor CI Run**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/<your-org>/<repo>/actions`
2. Look for latest run triggered by commit `c44b46a`
3. Click on the run
4. Expand both jobs:
   - "Unit Tests (fast)"
   - "E2E Tests (integration)"

### **Step 2: Review Diagnostic Steps**

**Look for these steps in logs:**
1. `[DEBUG] Environment and File Structure`
   - Check file counts
   - Verify specific files exist
   - Note working directory

2. `[DEBUG] Run Single Failing Test`
   - Read full error message
   - Check traceback
   - Identify missing file path

### **Step 3: Analyze Results**

**Questions to Answer:**
- ‚úÖ Do files exist? (Check file counts and specific file checks)
- ‚úÖ Are paths correct? (Compare test error path vs actual file location)
- ‚úÖ Is working directory correct? (Check pwd output)
- ‚úÖ Is PYTHONPATH set? (Check environment section)

### **Step 4: Apply Fix**

**Based on diagnosis, apply appropriate fix:**

**If files missing ‚Üí Add to Git:**
```bash
git add tests/fixtures/
git add tests/golden/
git commit -m "fix: add missing test fixtures"
```

**If paths wrong ‚Üí Update test imports:**
```python
# BEFORE
with open("fixtures/data.json") as f:

# AFTER
with open("tests/fixtures/data.json") as f:
```

**If PYTHONPATH wrong ‚Üí Update workflow:**
```yaml
env:
  PYTHONPATH: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests:${{ github.workspace }}"
```

**Commit Hash:** `c44b46a`

**Commit Message:**
```
feat(ci): add comprehensive diagnostic steps to identify FileNotFoundError

Added extensive diagnostic logging to both tests-unit and tests-e2e jobs

Changes:
1. Enable Git LFS in checkout step (lfs: true)
   - Ensures large files are properly downloaded

2. Add [DEBUG] Environment and File Structure step
   - Shows current working directory
   - Lists tests/, tests/fixtures/, tests/golden/ contents
   - Verifies specific critical files exist
   - Counts total files in fixture directories
   - Shows Python environment (version, path, PYTHONPATH)

3. Add [DEBUG] Run Single Failing Test step
   - Runs tests/test_finops_exporter_unit.py in isolation
   - Uses continue-on-error: true to not block main tests
   - Provides detailed traceback with --tb=short

Purpose:
Diagnose root cause of FileNotFoundError in CI environment

Expected outcome:
Logs will show exactly which files are missing and where CI is looking

Next steps:
1. Trigger CI run
2. Review [DEBUG] step outputs
3. Identify if files are missing or paths are incorrect
4. Fix based on diagnostic results
```

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (94 lines added)

**Impact:**
- No functional changes to test execution
- Additional diagnostic output only
- Minimal performance impact (~5-10 seconds per job)
