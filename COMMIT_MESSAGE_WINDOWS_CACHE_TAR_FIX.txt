fix(ci): Windows cache tar/gzip warnings - use bsdtar instead of Git Bash tar

Problem:
- actions/cache on Windows uses tar.exe from Git Bash
- Git Bash tar requires external gzip which is not available
- Causes "gzip: command not found" and "exit code 2" warnings in Post job cleanup

Solution:
- Add step [3/13] to prepend C:\Windows\System32 to PATH
- This ensures actions/cache uses Windows bsdtar (C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe)
- Windows bsdtar has built-in compression support (no external gzip needed)

Changes:
- .github/workflows/soak-windows.yml
  * New step [3/13]: "Prefer Windows tar (bsdtar) for actions/cache"
  * Renumbered all subsequent steps (1-12 → 1-13)

Impact:
✅ Eliminates gzip warnings in CI logs
✅ Uses native Windows tar (faster, more reliable)
✅ No changes to cache functionality or keys
✅ All cache steps remain green

Verification:
- No "gzip: command not found" errors
- No "tar.exe exit code 2" warnings
- Cache hit/miss detection works correctly
