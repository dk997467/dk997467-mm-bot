                    CI ARTIFACT V3->V4 MIGRATION - NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED IN BRANCH fix/ci-artifact-v4

WHAT WAS DONE:
- All 18 workflow files migrated to actions/upload-artifact@v4
- All 18 workflow files migrated to actions/download-artifact@v4  
- Added lint-step to 17 workflows (anti-regression protection)
- Changes committed and pushed to origin/fix/ci-artifact-v4
- Created comprehensive report: CI_ARTIFACT_V4_MIGRATION_REPORT.md

CRITICAL ISSUE:
- testnet-smoke.yml in main branch STILL USES v3!
- This is why CI continues to fail with "deprecated v3" error
- GitHub Actions runs workflows from the BASE branch (main), not feature branch

NEXT STEPS:

1. CREATE PULL REQUEST:
   
   Option A (GitHub Web):
   - Go to: https://github.com/dk997467/dk997467-mm-bot/compare/main...fix/ci-artifact-v4
   - Click "Create Pull Request"
   - Title: "ci: migrate artifact actions to v4 everywhere + anti-regression lint"
   - Body: Copy content from CI_ARTIFACT_V4_MIGRATION_REPORT.md
   
   Option B (GitHub CLI, if installed):
   gh pr create --title "ci: migrate artifact actions to v4 everywhere + anti-regression lint" \
     --body-file CI_ARTIFACT_V4_MIGRATION_REPORT.md \
     --base main --head fix/ci-artifact-v4

2. MERGE PR:
   - Review changes
   - Approve
   - Merge to main (recommended: Squash and merge)

3. VERIFICATION (AFTER merge to main):
   - Go to: https://github.com/dk997467/dk997467-mm-bot/actions/workflows/testnet-smoke.yml
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select branch "main"
   - Run
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   ✅ Stage "Prepare actions / Getting action download info" succeeds
   ✅ NO error "deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3"
   ✅ All steps execute normally

4. MONITORING:
   - Watch CI runs for the next week
   - Lint-step will automatically block any v3 regressions

================================================================================

KEY COMMITS:

60db621 docs(ci): add comprehensive artifact v3->v4 migration report
12b2ff7 fix(workflows): resolve 5 additional context access validation errors
b13ee08 fix(workflows): resolve 10 context access validation errors
52e6325 ci: migrate to actions/{upload,download}-artifact@v4
ecda9d9 ci(workflows): bump artifact actions to v4 (fix deprecation blocker)

================================================================================

VERIFICATION:

Current branch (fix/ci-artifact-v4):
- 0 occurrences of v3 ✅

Main branch:
- 3 occurrences of v3 in testnet-smoke.yml ❌

After merge:
- 0 occurrences of v3 everywhere ✅

================================================================================

ANTI-REGRESSION PROTECTION:

Every workflow now has a lint-step that:
- Runs FIRST (before any other steps)
- Scans all .github/ for v3 occurrences
- Fails immediately (exit code 1) if v3 found
- Blocks CI run before it starts

Example:
```yaml
- name: Lint - forbid artifact v3
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    if git grep -nE 'actions/(upload|download)-artifact\s*[@:]\s*v3(\b|[^0-9])' .github | tee /dev/stderr; then
      echo "Found deprecated artifact actions v3 — must use @v4" >&2
      exit 1
    fi
```
