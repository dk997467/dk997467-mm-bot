# === CURSOR IGNORE CONFIGURATION ===
# This file controls what Cursor AI can see and analyze
# For full project visibility (including artifacts), we keep this minimal

# Exclude heavy/irrelevant directories only

.venv/
node_modules/
dist/
build/
logs/
data/
tmp/

# Exclude Python cache directories
**/__pycache__/
**/.pytest_cache/
**/.mypy_cache/
**/.ruff_cache/

# === ARTIFACTS ARE NOW VISIBLE ===
# Previously artifacts/ was hidden here - REMOVED for full analysis capability
# Cursor can now read artifacts/latest/, artifacts/reports/, artifacts/soak/
# This is INTENTIONAL for debugging and analysis
