ci(windows): prefer Windows bsdtar for cache; replace anti-sleep module with background job

This commit implements two fixes to clean up Windows CI logs:

PROMPT 1 - Windows cache tar/gzip fix:
- Added step [3/13] to prepend C:\Windows\System32 to PATH
- Ensures actions/cache uses Windows bsdtar instead of Git Bash tar
- Eliminates "gzip: command not found" warnings
- Renumbered workflow steps (1-12 → 1-13)

PROMPT 2 - Anti-sleep simplification:
- Removed module-based anti-sleep protection
- Replaced with simple background job (Start-Job/Stop-Job)
- Eliminates "Export-ModuleMember" errors
- Simplified both init and cleanup steps (-79 lines)
- Changed heartbeat format to ISO 8601
- Removed keep_awake.ps1 from critical files check

Changes:
- .github/workflows/soak-windows.yml
  * New step [3/13]: "Prefer Windows tar (bsdtar) for actions/cache"
  * Renamed: "Keep runner awake (fallback)" → "Start keep-awake background job"
  * Renamed: "Stop anti-sleep" → "Stop keep-awake job"
  * Removed: tools\soak\keep_awake.ps1 from critical files

Impact:
✅ Eliminates tar/gzip warnings in Post job cleanup
✅ Eliminates module-related errors in anti-sleep steps
✅ Cleaner, more concise CI logs
✅ No changes to cache or anti-sleep functionality
✅ Net simplification: ~70 lines removed

Expected log output:
- Cache steps: No "gzip: command not found" errors
- Init: "[OK] Keep-awake job started. ID=42"
- Heartbeat: "[KEEP-AWAKE] Heartbeat at 2025-10-12T12:00:00.000Z"
- Cleanup: "[OK] Keep-awake job 42 stopped and removed"
