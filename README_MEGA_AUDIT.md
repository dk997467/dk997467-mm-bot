### Execution Scripts

| File | Platform | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **run_3h_soak.ps1** | Windows | 3-hour soak runner with auto-analysis |
| **run_3h_soak.sh** | Linux/Mac | 3-hour soak runner with auto-analysis |

---

## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### Step 1: Quick Review (5 minutes)

Read the **Quick Reference**:
```bash
cat MEGA_AUDIT_QUICK_REF.md
```

Key sections to focus on:
- **Component Breakdown Table** - Understand net_bps formula
- **Driver-Aware Tuning Matrix** - What auto-tuning will do
- **Success Criteria** - What to expect

---

### Step 2: Run 3-Hour Soak (3 hours)

#### Windows:
```powershell
.\run_3h_soak.ps1
```

#### Linux/Mac:
```bash
./run_3h_soak.sh
```

**What happens**:
1. Loads Profile S1 (`config/profiles/market_maker_S1.json`)
2. Applies baseline overrides (`artifacts/soak/runtime_overrides.json`)
3. Runs 6 iterations x 30min each = **3 hours total**
4. Auto-tuning adjusts parameters between iterations (driver-aware)
5. Generates EDGE_REPORT with diagnostics
6. Displays results summary with verdict

---

### Step 3: Review Results (5 minutes)

The script will automatically show:
- ✅ **net_bps** (primary metric)
- Component breakdown (gross, fees, slippage, inventory)
- Drivers (if net_bps < 0)
- Block reasons (min_interval, concurrency, risk, throttle)
- **Verdict**: SUCCESS / OK / WARN / FAIL

**Decision Matrix**:
```
net_bps ≥ 3.0  → ✅ SUCCESS → Run 24h stability soak
net_bps 2.8-3.0 → ⚠️ OK → Apply 1-2 adjustments, re-run 3h
net_bps 2.5-2.8 → ⚠️ WARN → Apply targeted package, re-run 3h
net_bps < 2.5   → ❌ FAIL → Review blocks + breakdown, investigate
```

---

### Step 4: Deep Dive (Optional, if needed)

If you need to understand **why** net_bps < 3.0 or **how** to tune:

Read the **Full Audit**:
```bash
cat MEGA_AUDIT_NET_BPS_3.0.md
```

Key sections:
- **Section B**: Component Breakdown Analysis (3 scenarios)
- **Section C**: Block Reasons & Calibration Hypotheses (5 hypotheses)
- **Section D**: Recommended Overrides Package (4 adjustment scenarios)
- **Section E**: Success Criteria (gates + checklist)

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Formula Verification ✅

**Status**: **CORRECT** (no changes needed)

```python
net_bps = gross_bps + fees_eff_bps + slippage_bps + inventory_bps
```

All signs are correct:
- `fees_eff_bps ≤ 0` (cost, negative)
- `inventory_bps ≤ 0` (cost, negative)
- `slippage_bps ±` (can be positive or negative)
- `adverse_bps` is **NOT** in formula (informational only)

---

### Primary Drivers of net_bps < 3.0 (Predicted)

Based on code analysis, **slippage_bps** is the most likely culprit:

| Driver | Mechanism | Probability | Impact |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **slippage_bps** | Positive slippage (paid more than quoted) | **HIGH** | -2 to -4 bps |
| **min_interval blocks** | Stale quotes → slippage ↑ | **HIGH** | -1 to -2 bps |
| **adverse_bps** | Indirect: cancels ↑ → order_age ↑ → slippage ↑ | **MEDIUM** | -1 to -2 bps |
| **concurrency blocks** | Limits updates → stale quotes | **MEDIUM** | -0.5 to -1 bps |

**Key Insight**: Negative slippage (price improvement) = GOOD. Positive slippage = BAD.

**Root Cause**: Stale quotes due to:
1. Order age too high (min_interval_ms too low → excessive blocks)
2. Insufficient spread (base_spread_bps_delta too low)
3. Excessive concurrency (replace_rate_per_min too high)

---

### Auto-Tuning System ✅

**Status**: **WELL-DESIGNED** (built-in guardrails)

The auto-tuning system in `tools/soak/run.py` will:
- ✅ Detect drivers (slippage, adverse, blocks) and adjust accordingly
- ✅ Apply age relief (optimization when execution is healthy)
- ✅ Trigger fallback mode (2 consecutive net_bps < 0 → conservative package)
- ✅ Guard against over-tuning (max 2 changes per field, max +0.10 spread delta)

**Confidence**: 70% that first 3h run achieves net_bps ≥ 2.8

---

### Baseline Overrides (Conservative Start)

**File**: `artifacts/soak/runtime_overrides.json`

```json
{
  "min_interval_ms": 70,          // +10 from best cell
  "replace_rate_per_min": 280,    // -20 from best cell
  "base_spread_bps_delta": 0.10,  // -0.25 from S1 profile
  "tail_age_ms": 650,              // -50 from S1
  "impact_cap_ratio": 0.09,        // -0.01 from best cell
  "max_delta_ratio": 0.14          // -0.01 from best cell
}
```

**Rationale**: Start conservative (narrower spread, moderate pacing) and let auto-tuning widen if slippage becomes a driver.

**Expected Baseline**: net_bps **2.0 - 2.5** → Auto-tuning → **2.8 - 3.2**

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Hard Gates (Must Pass)

| Metric | Threshold | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| net_bps_total | ≥ 2.5 | Minimum profitable edge |
| adverse_bps_p95 | ≤ 5.0 | Excessive adverse selection |
| cancel_ratio | ≤ 0.65 | Too much order churn |
| maker_share_pct | ≥ 80.0 | Minimum maker rebate capture |

### Soft Gates (Ideal Targets)

| Metric | Target | Ideal |
|--------|--------|-------|
| net_bps_total | ≥ 2.8 | ≥ **3.0** |
| slippage_bps_p95 | ≤ 3.5 | ≤ 3.0 |
| order_age_p95_ms | ≤ 340 | ≤ 330 |
| ws_lag_p95_ms | ≤ 130 | ≤ 120 |
| maker_share_pct | ≥ 85.0 | ≥ 90.0 |

## 🔧 TUNING SCENARIOS (AUTO-APPLIED)

Auto-tuning will detect drivers and apply one of these scenarios:

### Scenario A: Slippage Dominant
- **Trigger**: `slippage_bps` in `neg_edge_drivers`
- **Action**: Widen spread (+0.02 to +0.05), increase tail_age (+50-100)
- **Effect**: +1.0 to +2.0 bps

### Scenario B: Adverse Dominant
- **Trigger**: `adverse_bps_p95 > 4.0`
- **Action**: Lower impact_cap (-0.02 to -0.04), tighten max_delta (-0.02 to -0.04)
- **Effect**: +0.5 to +1.5 bps

### Scenario C: Age Relief (Optimization)
- **Trigger**: `order_age > 330` AND execution healthy
- **Action**: Decrease min_interval (-10), increase replace_rate (+30)
- **Effect**: +0.3 to +0.7 bps (faster quotes without degrading fills)

### Scenario D: Fallback Mode (Emergency)
- **Trigger**: 2 consecutive iterations with `net_bps < 0`
- **Action**: Conservative package (widen spread, slow down pacing)
- **Effect**: Recovery to positive net_bps in 1-2 iterations

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: net_bps < 2.5 (FAIL)

**Symptoms**:
- EDGE_REPORT shows negative net_bps or very low (< 2.5)
- Multiple drivers active
- High block ratios

**Actions**:
1. Check `artifacts/soak/summary.txt` for failure iteration
2. Review `neg_edge_drivers` (which components dragging down)
3. Review `block_reasons` (which blocks > 40%)
4. Apply conservative package from Section D (Scenario D) of full audit
5. Re-run 3h soak

---

### Issue 2: Auto-Tuning Not Applying Adjustments

**Symptoms**:
- Final `runtime_overrides.json` identical to initial
- No `| autotune | DRIVER:* |` markers in stdout

**Causes**:
- No EDGE_REPORT generated (check `artifacts/EDGE_REPORT.json` exists)
- Metrics within healthy range (no triggers activated)
- Multi-fail guard activated (3+ triggers → only calm down)

**Actions**:
1. Verify EDGE_REPORT exists after iteration
2. Check if metrics are already healthy (no tuning needed)
3. Review stdout for `| autotune |` markers

---

### Issue 3: Oscillation (Parameters Ping-Pong)

**Symptoms**:
- spread_delta increases, then decreases, then increases again
- net_bps fluctuates wildly between iterations

**Causes**:
- Metrics at threshold boundary
- Age relief triggering prematurely

**Actions**:
1. Check if age relief is triggering (should only if execution healthy)
2. Review if spread_delta cap (+0.10 per iteration) is being hit
3. Consider freezing overrides after first convergence

**Note**: Unlikely due to max-2-changes-per-field guard.

---

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Formula is Already Correct ✅

No changes needed to `tools/edge_audit.py`. The net_bps formula:
```python
net_bps = gross_bps + fees_eff_bps + slippage_bps + inventory_bps
```
is **correct** with proper sign conventions:
- fees_eff_bps ≤ 0 (normalized at calculation time)
- inventory_bps ≤ 0 (always cost)
- adverse_bps NOT included (informational)

### 2. slippage_bps is the Primary Lever

Negative slippage = GOOD (got better price than quoted).  
Positive slippage = BAD (paid more than quoted).

**Root causes of positive slippage**:
- Stale quotes (order_age too high)
- Insufficient spread (not enough cushion against adverse moves)
- Excessive concurrency (partial fills causing reprices)

### 3. Auto-Tuning is Driver-Aware

The system already has sophisticated logic to:
- Detect slippage vs adverse vs blocks
- Apply targeted adjustments per driver
- Guard against over-tuning
- Fallback when multiple failures

**Confidence**: System is well-designed to converge.
