feat(autotune): add Age Relief mechanism for order aging correction

Implements PROMPT F - soft correction that reduces order_age_p95_ms
WITHOUT harming execution quality (adverse/slippage).

Problem:
- High order_age_p95_ms (>330ms) previously triggered "calming" adjustments
- These would reduce replace_rate and increase wait times
- Reduced aggressiveness could miss profitable opportunities

Solution - Age Relief:
  Trigger: order_age > 330 AND adverse ≤ 4 AND slippage ≤ 3
  Action: Make strategy MORE aggressive (but safely)
    - min_interval_ms -= 10 (min: 50)
    - replace_rate_per_min += 30 (max: 330)
  
  Key: NOT a failure - doesn't increment fail_count

Changes:
- tools/soak/run.py
  * Replaced old order_age trigger with Age Relief
  * Extract metrics once at top (avoid duplication)
  * Age Relief only applies when execution quality is good
  * Updated mock data to demonstrate Age Relief
  * Markers: | autotune | AGE_RELIEF | field from=X to=Y |

- tests/unit/test_runtime_tuning.py
  * test_trigger_age_relief_applied: verifies Age Relief works
  * test_trigger_age_relief_not_applied_bad_adverse: verifies safety (adverse > 4)
  * test_trigger_age_relief_not_applied_bad_slippage: verifies safety (slippage > 3)
  * test_trigger_age_relief_respects_limits: verifies min/max limits

Markers:
  | autotune | AGE_RELIEF | min_interval_ms from=60 to=50 |
  | autotune | AGE_RELIEF | replace_rate_per_min from=300 to=330 |
  | autotune | AGE_RELIEF | order_age=350ms adverse=3.30 slippage=2.35 |

Impact:
✅ Reduces order age when safe to do so
✅ Doesn't harm execution quality (conditional trigger)
✅ More aggressive = better performance in good conditions
✅ Doesn't trigger multi-fail guard (not a failure)
✅ Respects all safety limits (50ms min, 330/min max)

Acceptance Test:
  MM_PROFILE=S1 python -m tools.soak.run --iterations 3 --auto-tune --mock
  → Age Relief triggers in iterations 2-3 (good execution quality)
  → min_interval: 60 → 50 (at limit)
  → replace_rate: 270 → 300 → 330 (at limit)
  → Markers printed for all adjustments

Tests: 14/14 unit tests passing
