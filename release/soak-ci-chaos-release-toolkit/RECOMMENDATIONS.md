# Soak Test Recommendations

**Status:** PROD-READY

## Status: All Goals Met [OK]

All KPI targets achieved for last-8 iterations. System is stable and ready for production freeze.

### Optional Optimizations (Low Priority)

#### 1. Maker/Taker Optimization (Current: 85.0%)

**Current:** 0.850 (85.0%)
**Target:** 0.90+ (90%+)

**Suggested Deltas:**
```python
base_spread_bps_delta += 0.01  # Wider spreads -> more maker
replace_rate_per_min *= 0.95    # Less aggressive repricing
min_interval_ms += 10           # Reduce quote churn
```

**Expected Impact:** +2-3% maker share, -0.5 BPS net (acceptable trade-off)

#### 2. Latency Margin (Current: 180 ms)

**Current:** 180.0 ms (excellent, large margin vs 340ms cap)
No changes needed.

#### 3. Guard Tuning

Guard behavior looks good. No changes needed.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Apply deltas incrementally** - Test each change in isolation
2. **Run 12-24 iterations** after each change to validate
3. **Monitor all KPIs** - Ensure no regressions
4. **Use delta verifier** - Confirm 95%+ apply ratio
