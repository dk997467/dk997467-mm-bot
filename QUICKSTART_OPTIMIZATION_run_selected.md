# ⚡ Quick Start: Optimize `run_selected.py`

**Goal:** Fix >5 minute CI timeout by implementing parallel test execution  
**Expected Result:** ~4-5x speedup (5 min → ~1 min)  
**Effort:** 5 minutes  
**Risk:** Low

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Add pytest-xdist Dependency (30 seconds)

```bash
# Check if already installed
pip list | grep pytest-xdist

# If not found, add to requirements.txt
echo "pytest-xdist>=3.5.0" >> requirements.txt

# Install locally for testing
pip install pytest-xdist
```

---

### Step 2: Apply Minimal Fix (2 minutes)

**Option A: Minimal Change (Recommended for immediate fix)**

Edit `tools/ci/run_selected.py`:

```python
# Line 16 - BEFORE:
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", "-q", *paths]

# Line 16 - AFTER:
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", "-q", "-n", "auto", *paths]
#                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                                              Add parallel execution
```

**That's it!** One-line change for 4x speedup.

---

**Option B: Full Optimization (Recommended for long-term)**

Replace entire `tools/ci/run_selected.py` with `tools/ci/run_selected_optimized.py`:

```bash
# Backup original
cp tools/ci/run_selected.py tools/ci/run_selected_original.py

# Use optimized version
cp tools/ci/run_selected_optimized.py tools/ci/run_selected.py
```

This gives you:
- ✅ Parallel execution
- ✅ Detailed profiling
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Better debugging

---

### Step 3: Local Testing (2 minutes)

```bash
# Test the optimized script
time python tools/ci/run_selected.py

# Expected output:
# [PROFILE] Starting: Environment setup
# [PROFILE] Environment setup: 0.001s
# [PROFILE] Starting: File loading and parsing
# [PROFILE] Loaded 81 test paths
# [PROFILE] File loading and parsing: 0.002s
# ...
# [PROFILE] Pytest execution (parallel): 60.234s
# 
# ===========================
# PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
# ===========================
# Total tests executed: 81
# Total execution time: 60.45s (1.0 min)
# Average time per test: 0.75s
# Parallel workers: auto
# Performance rating: 🟢 EXCELLENT
```

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ Total time < 120s (2 minutes)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No warnings about test isolation

---

### Step 4: Commit & Push (1 minute)

```bash
git add requirements.txt tools/ci/run_selected.py
git commit -m "perf(ci): add parallel execution to run_selected.py

- Added pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
- Changed from sequential to parallel execution (-n auto)
- Expected 4-5x speedup: 5 min → ~1 min
- Fixes CI timeout issues

Resolves: CI timeout in run_selected tests"

git push
```

---

### Step 5: Verify in CI (Monitor)

1. Wait for CI to run
2. Check GitHub Actions workflow timing
3. Verify execution time < 2 minutes

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Workflow completes without timeout
- ✅ All 81 tests pass
- ✅ Execution time < 120 seconds

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Module not found: xdist"

**Symptom:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xdist'
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure pytest-xdist is in requirements.txt
grep xdist requirements.txt

# If missing, add it:
echo "pytest-xdist>=3.5.0" >> requirements.txt

# Re-install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Issue 2: Test Isolation Failures

**Symptom:**
```
FAILED tests/test_something.py - ResourceWarning: unclosed file
```

**Fix:**
```python
# Add marker to problematic test
import pytest

@pytest.mark.serial  # Force sequential execution for this test
def test_with_shared_resource():
    ...
```

---

### Issue 3: High Memory Usage

**Symptom:**
- CI runner OOM (out of memory)
- System becomes unresponsive

**Fix:**
```python
# Limit number of workers
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", "-q", "-n", "4", *paths]
#                                                      ^^^
#                                                      Limit to 4 workers instead of "auto"
```

---

### Issue 4: Non-Deterministic Failures

**Symptom:**
- Tests pass sometimes, fail other times
- Different failures on each run

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add pytest-rerunfailures
pip install pytest-rerunfailures

# Modify command to retry flaky tests
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", "-q", "-n", "auto", 
       "--reruns", "2",  # Retry failed tests twice
       "--reruns-delay", "1",  # Wait 1s between retries
       *paths]
```

## 🎯 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current (Sequential) | Expected (Parallel) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Execution time | < 2 min | ~5.4 min ❌ | ~1.3 min ✅ |
| Avg per test | < 1.5s | ~4s | ~1s |

## ✅ Checklist

**Before deployment:**
- [ ] pytest-xdist added to requirements.txt
- [ ] run_selected.py modified with `-n auto`
- [ ] Tested locally (execution < 2 min)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No test isolation issues observed

**After deployment:**
- [ ] CI workflow completes without timeout
- [ ] Execution time < 2 minutes
- [ ] All 81 tests pass in CI
- [ ] Performance metrics look good

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If parallel execution causes issues:

```bash
# Restore original
git revert HEAD

# Or manually revert the change:
# In tools/ci/run_selected.py, line 16:
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", "-q", *paths]
# (Remove "-n", "auto")
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring

**Track these metrics in CI:**

1. **Total execution time** (target: <2 min)
2. **Collection time** (target: <20s)
3. **Number of workers used** (should match CPU cores)
4. **Memory usage** (should be <2GB)

**Add to CI reporting:**
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/*.yml
- name: Performance metrics
  if: always()
  run: |
    echo "Test execution completed in $(date -u -d @$SECONDS +%M:%S)"
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Optimizations)

1. **Split unit/e2e tests** (separate CI jobs)
2. **Enable pytest cache** (skip unchanged tests)
3. **Add test sharding** (distribute across multiple runners)
4. **Profile individual tests** (identify slowest tests)

---

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO DEPLOY**

**Expected outcome:** CI timeout issue resolved with minimal risk! 🎉
