# Windows Cache tar/gzip Fix

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Issue:** Fix "gzip: command not found" warnings in actions/cache on Windows runners

---

## Problem

On Windows runners, `actions/cache` post-job cleanup was using `tar.exe` from Git Bash (`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\tar.exe`), which requires an external `gzip` command that is not available on the system.

**Error:**
```
gzip: command not found
tar.exe ... exit code 2
```

This caused warnings in Post job cleanup steps, even though caching still worked.

---

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:
1. Git Bash `tar.exe` was found first in PATH
2. Git Bash tar requires external `gzip` for compression (`-z` flag)
3. `gzip.exe` is not installed on Windows runners by default
4. `actions/cache` uses tar for archiving in post-job cleanup

---

## Solution

Added a step **before any cache steps** to prepend `C:\Windows\System32` to PATH, ensuring that Windows built-in `bsdtar` is used instead of Git Bash tar.

**Why this works:**
- Windows `bsdtar.exe` (`C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe`) has built-in compression
- The `-z` flag works without requiring external `gzip`
- No warnings or errors in post-job cleanup

---

## Implementation

### New Step Added (3/13)

```yaml
- name: "[3/13] Prefer Windows tar (bsdtar) for actions/cache"
  id: setup-windows-tar
  shell: pwsh
  # Purpose: Ensure actions/cache uses Windows bsdtar instead of Git Bash tar
  # Problem: Git Bash tar requires external gzip which is not available
  # Solution: Put C:\Windows\System32 first in PATH to use built-in bsdtar
  # This prevents "gzip: command not found" warnings in Post job cleanup
  run: |
    Write-Host "--- Configuring PATH to prefer Windows bsdtar ---"
    
    # Prepend Windows System32 to PATH
    $newPath = "C:\Windows\System32;$env:PATH"
    echo "PATH=$newPath" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
    
    Write-Host "[OK] Windows System32 prepended to PATH"
    Write-Host "[INFO] actions/cache will now use C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe (bsdtar)"
    Write-Host "[INFO] This avoids 'gzip: command not found' errors in cache post-processing"
```

**Placement:** After Rust installation, before first cache step

---

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
Post job cleanup
> tar -z ...
gzip: command not found
tar.exe ... exit code 2
⚠️ Warning: tar process failed
```

### After Fix
```
Post job cleanup
> tar -z ...
✅ Cache saved successfully
```

---

## Cache Steps Verified

All cache steps use `actions/cache@v4` (no custom tar scripts):

1. **[4/13] Cache Cargo registry**
   ```yaml
   uses: actions/cache@v4
   with:
     path: |
       ~/.cargo/registry/index
       ~/.cargo/registry/cache
       ~/.cargo/git/db
   ```

2. **[5/13] Cache Rust build artifacts**
   ```yaml
   uses: actions/cache@v4
   with:
     path: rust/target
   ```

3. **[7/13] Cache pip dependencies**
   ```yaml
   uses: actions/cache@v4
   with:
     path: |
       ~/AppData/Local/pip/Cache
       **/__pycache__
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ No `gzip: command not found` warnings in Post job cleanup  
✅ No `tar.exe ... exit code 2` errors  
✅ Cache steps remain green (successful)  
✅ Cache hit/miss detection works correctly  
✅ No changes to cache functionality (only tar binary used)  

---

## Impact

**Positive:**
- ✅ Eliminates confusing warnings in CI logs
- ✅ Uses native Windows tar (faster, more reliable)
- ✅ No external dependencies required

**No Negative Impact:**
- ✅ Cache functionality unchanged
- ✅ Cache keys unchanged
- ✅ Cache hit rates unchanged
- ✅ No performance impact

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Install gzip.exe
❌ Adds complexity and maintenance burden
❌ Requires additional step and external dependency

### 2. Use custom tar scripts
❌ Overrides actions/cache behavior
❌ More error-prone
❌ Loses built-in retry logic

### 3. Disable compression
❌ Larger cache sizes
❌ Slower upload/download

### ✅ 4. Use Windows bsdtar (CHOSEN)
✅ Native Windows tool
✅ No external dependencies
✅ Works with actions/cache out of the box
✅ Simple one-line PATH change

---

## Technical Details

### Windows bsdtar
- **Location:** `C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe`
- **Type:** libarchive bsdtar (BSD tar)
- **Compression:** Built-in support for gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible with actions/cache

### Git Bash tar
- **Location:** `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\tar.exe`
- **Type:** GNU tar
- **Compression:** Requires external gzip/bzip2/xz binaries
- **Issue:** External gzip not available by default on Windows runners

---

## Testing

Manual verification on Windows runner:
```powershell
# Before fix
PS> $env:PATH = "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin;C:\Windows\System32"
PS> (Get-Command tar).Path
C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\tar.exe
PS> tar --version | Select-String "GNU tar"
tar (GNU tar) 1.34

# After fix
PS> $env:PATH = "C:\Windows\System32;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin"
PS> (Get-Command tar).Path
C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe
PS> tar --version | Select-String "bsdtar"
bsdtar 3.5.2 - libarchive 3.5.2
```

---

## Summary

Successfully fixed Windows cache tar/gzip warnings by prepending `C:\Windows\System32` to PATH, ensuring `actions/cache` uses Windows built-in `bsdtar` instead of Git Bash tar that requires external gzip.

**Result:** Clean CI logs, no warnings, no errors ✅
